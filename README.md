**Step 5:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard.

**3. Key Features Overview:**

**a. Data Visualization:**
   - The dashboard provides visually appealing charts and graphs to represent various data metrics.
   - Users can customize the data range and type of visualization (line chart, bar chart, pie chart, etc.).

**b. User Authentication:**
   - Secure login functionality ensures that only authorized users can access the dashboard.
   - Administrators can manage user roles and permissions.

**c. Real-time Updates:**
   - The dashboard updates data in real-time, ensuring users always have access to the latest information.
   - WebSocket integration allows for seamless communication between the server and client.

**d. Export Functionality:**
   - Users can export data and charts in various formats (CSV, PDF, PNG, etc.) for further analysis or reporting purposes.

**4. How to Use:**

**a. Login:**
   - Enter your username and password to access the dashboard.
   - If you don't have an account, contact the administrator to create one for you.

**b. Dashboard Navigation:**
